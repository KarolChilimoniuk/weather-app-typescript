### Introduction ⏩
Hello World! This is my weather app built with React library + Typescript. Project contains client side and server side. I used create-react-app, axios, react-router-dom in client side. For server side I used express, cors, dotenv and node-fetch. Deployment for server side had been done with heroku at first, but due to heroku remove free services since 28th November 2022 I put my server on Render. Netlify is used for client side deployment.
