### Introduction ⏩
Hello World! This is my weather app built with React library + Typescript. Project contains client side and server side. I used create-react-app, axios, react-router-dom in client side. For server side I used express, cors, dotenv and node-fetch. 
*****App migrated from Heroku to Render and may take 45-120 sec to spin up the serveronce loaded.*****
