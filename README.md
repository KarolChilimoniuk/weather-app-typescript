### Introduction ⏩
Hello World! This is my weather app built with React library. Project contains client side and server side. I used create-react-app, axios, react-router-dom and propTypes in client side. For server side I used express, cors, dotenv and node-fetch. Deployment had been done with heroku (for backend side) and netlify (for client side).
